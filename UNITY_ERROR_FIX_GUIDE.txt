ECLIPSE REBORN - UNITY COMPILATION ERROR FIX GUIDE
=================================================

✅ STEP 1: ENTER SAFE MODE
- In Unity dialog, click "Enter Safe Mode"
- This allows Unity to open without running problematic scripts

✅ STEP 2: CHECK CONSOLE WINDOW
- In Unity, go to Window > General > Console
- Look for red error messages
- Common errors and fixes:

🔧 COMMON COMPILATION ERRORS & FIXES:

1. "The type or namespace 'Text' could not be found"
   FIX: Add this to top of AutoSceneBuilder.cs:
   using UnityEngine.UI;

2. "The type or namespace 'TMPro' could not be found"
   FIX: Already fixed - removed TMPro dependency

3. "Assembly 'Unity.Multiplayer.Center' will not be loaded"
   FIX: Ignore this - it's a package warning, not an error

4. "Script class cannot be found"
   FIX: Right-click in Project > Reimport All

✅ STEP 3: ONCE ERRORS ARE FIXED
- Unity will automatically recompile
- Exit Safe Mode
- You should see the "Eclipse Reborn" menu appear
