You are a senior mobile game developer, system designer, and Unity C# engineer. Build a complete developer bundle for a mobile 2D action RPG titled:

  ECLIPSE REBORN: Chronicles of the Lost Sun

Requirements:
- Target: Android & iOS mobile (Unity C# project conventions). If engine-specific binaries can't be created, output all source code, assets listings, JSON, and clear instructions so the project can be assembled in Unity.
- Gameplay: Free-to-play, playable without paying. Include optional limited rewarded-ads for small bonuses and many top-up (IAP) options for convenience/cosmetics. Short session loops (3–7 minutes), base-building (Sanctuary), and real-time touch combat.
- Tone: Hand-painted chibi/HD-2D pixel style. Keep design mobile-friendly (touch, button sizes, low memory).

Output required (create these files in the Replit workspace or present them as code/text outputs):

1) /design.md — Full design document (structured headings). Include:
   - One-paragraph pitch, core loop, session and retention targets.
   - World & lore summary, three main story arcs, three factions, 5 sample heroes with roles.
   - Gameplay systems: combat, stats, XP curve (include numeric XP table for levels 1–20), base nurturing design, idle/offline production, crafting.
   - Monetization: rewarded ads strategy (what rewards, limits per day), IAP top-ups list (names, exact effects, pricing tiers in USD and in-game currency prices), VIP pass, battle pass, cosmetic bundles, and fairness notes.
   - UX flow for purchases, ad flows, and anti-exploit considerations.

2) /data/game_config.json — Core numeric tuning and data:
   - XP formula and level table for 1–50.
   - Damage formula constants, defense formula, crit multipliers.
   - Building base costs and production rates (base_costs, growth factors).
   - Currency definitions (gold, crystals, solar shards/premium).

3) /data/hero_templates.json — 5 hero definitions (Auron, Lyra, Ronan, Cira, Milo) with:
   - Stats at level 1, growth per level, skills (with multipliers, cooldowns, cast times), animation frame counts (recommended), and role tags.

4) /assets/asset_list.csv — Complete asset inventory table with columns:
   - asset_id, type (sprite/vfx/sfx/ui), recommended_format, resolution, frames (if sprite sheet), notes (layer, pivot).
   - Include placeholders for all characters, VFX, environment tilesets, UI sprites, and audio.

5) /unity_scripts/ — Provide production-ready C# source files (well-commented) for:
   - PlayerController.cs — touch joystick movement, dash, basic attack, skill input mapping, animation parameter setting.
   - AnimatorSetup.txt — description of Animator parameters, state machine diagram, and animation event hooks with the exact function names to call from events.
   - CombatSystem.cs — damage calc, crit, DOT, status application; make methods deterministic and testable.
   - XPSystem.cs — add_xp, xp_to_next calculation, level_up routine with stat allocation.
   - BaseManager.cs — building production tick, offline accumulation (using last_saved_timestamp), upgrade method (with instant-upgrade IAP hook).
   - ShopManager.cs — IAP stubs, rewarded-ad hook, purchase flow with server-sync pseudo code and anti-duplication checks.
   - SaveLoadManager.cs — JSON save structure, offline production reconciliation, and sample local save data.

6) /ui/mockups/ — Text descriptions or ASCII mockups (or base64 placeholder PNGs) of:
   - Mobile HUD layout: joystick, skill buttons, auto-toggle, mini-map, base button.
   - Base screen layout: building grid, upgrade panel, production timers with watch-ad button for +X% bonus.
   - Shop layout: tabs for Top-up, Bundles, Battle Pass, Offers.

7) /monetization/monetization_plan.md — Explicit list of monetization products with exact values:
   - Rewarded-ads: max 3 per day free players, each gives x gold or y resource pack; optional ad for double offline for 1 hour.
   - IAP items: example prices and exact in-game benefits:
       * Starter Pack ($4.99): 1200 shards + 3x XP boosters (1h) + exclusive skin
       * Progression Boost ($9.99): instant base upgrade kit + 7-day XP+10%
       * Solar Blessing Pass ($29.99/month): daily shards, VIP perks (reduced timers), exclusive mount (cosmetic)
       * Legendary Chest ($49.99): guaranteed legendary weapon + cosmetic.
   - Battle Pass (free + premium tracks): free track gives small rewards; premium track gives skins, shards, and skip tickets.
   - Keep all game-play altering items optional; include balance notes so F2P progress is slower but feasible.

8) /server/pseudo_api.txt — Server sync pseudocode and endpoints:
   - endpoints: /purchase, /redeem_reward, /save_state, /claim_offline
   - For purchases: verify receipts, idempotency token, timestamp checks.
   - For ads: issue ephemeral signed reward token to prevent replay.

9) /playable_demo/README.md — Instructions to assemble a minimal playable prototype in Unity:
   - How to import spritesheets, set up Animator with provided parameters, attach PlayerController, and run a simple scene with one hero, one enemy, and base UI button.
   - Provide minimal scene setup steps, GameObjects required, and demo input mapping for mobile (Unity Remote or on-device).

10) /README.md — Project summary and step-by-step runbook for a small team to pick up and finish the prototype in 2–4 sprints (developer tasks, art tasks, audio tasks, QA checklist).

Constraints & style:
- Use clear, actionable code comments and keep code modular (no monolithic classes). Keep memory and GC considerations in mind for mobile (use object pooling for projectiles/VFX).
- For monetization, emphasize fairness: small ad rewards, many non-pay ways to obtain resources, and top-ups are mostly convenience/skins/time-savers.
- Provide concrete numeric values; avoid “tune later” placeholders. Use realistic mobile friendly numbers (e.g., XP per level, production per hour, ad limits).
- Output everything in plain files or code blocks that can be saved directly.

If you can generate any placeholder sprites or simple PNG mockups, create 64x64 hero placeholders and simple UI button placeholders in /ui/mockups as base64-encoded PNG files and reference them in /assets/asset_list.csv.

Now produce the full bundle as described, starting with /design.md content followed by the most important code files (PlayerController.cs, CombatSystem.cs, XPSystem.cs) and the JSON files. Keep replies focused and provide file contents ready to be saved.
